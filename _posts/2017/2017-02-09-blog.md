As some of you know, I haven't had the best experience in Bologna before this day trip.  Flying into Florence for the first time, my plane got diverted to land in Bologna because of strong winds!  It was very scary, and everyone was in a pretty bad mood because of the situation.  We all joked that we wouldn't ever come back to Bologna because of our negative experiences, but I decided to give it a second chance!  **And I sure am happy I did!**

## Climbing the Torre degli Asinelli

Bologna has many towers throughout the city, but one of the most famous is the Torre degli Asinelli.  It is 319 feet high and was created in 1109.

Of course, we had to climb to the top!  All **498** steps!  Climbing up was very scary!  The staircases were extremely narrow and it almost seemed like we were climbing ladders because it was so steep.  This tower wasn't designed for tall people (like me) because many times a random pole would almost hit me in the head!  It's a miracle that I left this tower without my first trip to the Emergency Room!

When we finally made it to the top were *first of all* exhausted and *second of all* in shock by the beautiful view!  It was a bit of a cloudy day, but we could still see the entire city and many surrounding mountains.  It made the hundreds of stairs feel worth it.

*SO happy to sit after climbing all of those stairs!*

## The Famous Bologna Lasagna!

Bologna is well known across Italy for its great lasagna.  After hiking up the stairs, my friends and I made a stop at a local restaurant to try their lasagna... and it was amazing!  Italian food will never get old to me if you can't tell!

These were just a few of the highlights from my time in Bologna!  Wow, am I happy I came back after a terrible first impression!

Next weekend I will be traveling to Brussels, Belgium!  The foodie in me can't contain my excitement for the waffles and fries!

Ciao for now! <br>
