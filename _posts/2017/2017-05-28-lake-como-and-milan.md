To hit more cities in Italy before my semester ended, I spent a day traveling to both Milan and Lake Como.  Although I wish I had more time to explore both cities, I was so happy I found time to travel to them!

# Como, Italy

I started off my morning by taking a train from Florence to Lake Como.  When I arrived at the Lake Como station, I immediately headed for the lake!  I walked along the lake looking at the beautiful blue water, surrounding mountains, and blooming trees surrounding me.

With my few hours in the city to spare, I decided to take a Funicular up a mountain to the town of Brunate.  The lines to buy tickets were very long, and I was worried that I was wasting my time in Como.  Luckily, I made it up in time to enjoy the view and wow it was worth it!

By the time I got back down, I used the rest of my time in the city to enjoy a picnic on the side of the lake and soak in the scenery.  Then I quickly headed to the train station to catch my ride to Milano!

# Milano, Italy

The moment I got out of the train station in Milan I could tell it had a completely different feel than most Italian cities.  It is much more industrial, especially since it is the economic center of Italy.  Walking around in the big city reminded me of New York City, and I loved it!

From the train station I walked straight to the Duomo di Milano.  The Duomo is incredibly beautiful in person!  I was mesmerized by the gothic architecture of the cathedral.  Unfortunately, the square surrounding the cathedral is overloaded with pigeons! And pigeons are probably my least favorite thing about Europe.  While I was trying to enjoy the views, it was hard to relax when pigeons were swarming by and I could feel feathers constantly brushing up against myself!  Not sure when I will overcome my pigeon fear... but standing in that square definitely didn't help haha!

After exploring more of the city, I enjoyed a delicious Italian meal and headed back to Florence on a bus.  Although the bus ride was longer, it was significantly cheaper than any of the trains and allowed me to stay longer in the city.

It was a little hectic seeing both cities in the same day, but it all paid off! Glad that I got to explore these Italian gems!

Ciao! <br>
