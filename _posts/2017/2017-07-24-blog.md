The semester I spent abroad in Florence was the best semester of my life!  I am so grateful for the opportunity I had to study abroad.

## Top highlights from studying abroad in Florence:
* Amazing travel opportunities thanks to 4 day weekends and cheap RyanAir flights!
* Making new friends from all over the world and sharing these travel experiences with them
* Learning more of the Italian language and culture, including the history on how Florence was the center of the renaissance!
* Teaching English to a class of Italian 5th graders every week
* Trying new things like watercolors, photojournalism, and cooking
* Having a deeper understanding and appreciation for art and museums
* Broadening my perspective on the world and learning more about myself while doing it

Also, I will still be abroad until early August as I transition into an internship in Switzerland.

Ciao!
