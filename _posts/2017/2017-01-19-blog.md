I've been in Florence for almost a week now and I love it!  I've already had 4 paninis, some really good wine, met amazing new friends, and actually got to use some of my Italian without making a complete fool of myself!  I'm even starting to know my way around the city too.  Here are some general updates about my travels, my adjustment to Florence, and la bella vita di Firenze!

## Travel nightmare

After packing up my things and saying goodbye to family and friends, I encountered another difficult situation that I wasn't expecting... an emergency landing in Bologna, Italy on my flight from Paris to Florence.

Definitely one of the scariest experiences of my life!  The pilot tried to land in Florence but the crosswinds were too strong and suddenly there was insane turbulence!  Everyone on the plane was getting sick and the flight attendants made announcements reminding us to leave all luggage and items on the plane in the event of an emergency.  Luckily, we safely landed in Bologna and everyone on the plane was okay!  Then we had to take an hour and a half bus ride to the Florence airport. 

Definitely safe to say that I couldn't be more relieved to finally be in Florence!

## L'appartamento

I live in an apartment with 5 other American study abroad students in my program.  Our apartment has 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 15 foot ceilings, a balcony, and huge windows!  Definitely exceeded all of my expectations!

The one thing I am adjusting to is the Italian concept of heat.  Most Italian apartments are very cold and only run the heat for about 2 hours a day.  In the effort to not over pack, I didn't bring many sweaters so I've had to get creative with my layering to not wake up shivering!  When it gets warmer it definitely won't be so bad... but unfortunately, it's been very cold in Italy.  Very windy and temps around 35 degrees Fahrenheit. I wish I had my parka... it's hard to believe that I'm a Minnesotan!

I am so grateful for my roommates. We all get along well and are looking forward to exploring Florence together!

## Wandering Around the City

Florence is beautiful!  I love the narrow old streets, cobblestone paths, cute little cafes everywhere you turn, friendly people, adorable dogs everywhere, unique charm and character of each building, and the gorgeous historical landmarks that I'm surrounded by!  I've even woken up to church bells and birds singing everyday... basically I'm in a fairy tale!

During our orientation, we got to see il Duomo *(Which means Cathedral in Italian, not dome.  Although it is the building with the large dome!)*, many different piazzas, the Arno River, Ponte Vecchio *(Meaning the old bridge.  Literally, it was believed to be first built in Roman times)*, and we did a gorgeous hike up to Piazzale Michelangelo *(An amazing viewpoint that overlooks the whole city)*.

Believe it or not, my camera ran out of battery my first weekend because I couldn't stop taking pictures of the gorgeous scenes!  Enjoy a few favorites of the ones I took below before it lost battery...

If you can't tell, I'm having a blast!  So far all of my classes are great too.  Looking forward to see where Italy will take me next! *(Hopefully to a gelateria... Still haven't tried gelato yet!!!)*

Ciao! <br>
