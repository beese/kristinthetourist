Prague is a real life fairytale. All of the buildings are gorgeous, there are many castles, sweets everywhere including their famous donut cone, and an old astronomical clock. My friends and I had a blast exploring what the mysterious city had to offer!



## John Lennon Wall
One of the first things we did in Prague was heading towards the famous John Lennon wall. I have seen so many photos of this wall before, so I was very excited to see it in person! When we first saw the wall, we weren't sure if we were in the right place. The wall was a lot smaller than we all imagined, especially after seeing the East Side Gallery in Berlin. The message still is amazing. The wall is a symbol for world peace and love and can be graffitied by anyone. Everyday the wall looks different because people add sayings of peace and love on the wall.

## Fairytale Prague
As I mentioned earlier, Prague truly is a fairytale. The gorgeous river with swans and the castle up on the hill seemed too good to be true. One day we walked up to the castle. It was breathtaking! You could look over the whole city from the top. We explored some of the old castle buildings and an old cathedral. Similar to London, there were guards everywhere and we even got to watch a small ceremony go on where he guards changed places.

## Food!
The food in Prague was amazing!!! It also helps that Prague is a relatively cheap city: you could have a large beer for 1-2$ and a full nice sit down meal for less than 10$! Prague is known for a lot of its good meat. I tried goulash, and other beef stews. I also tried some classic Prague pilsners! The classic dessert that I ended up having 3 (!!!) times was the famous donut ice cream cone. Each stand we went to served the cone a little bit differently. It tasted like a churro cone and sometimes they would line it with chocolate and fill the cone with ice cream or whipped cream. It was definitely a sugar rush!

## Astronomical Clock
One of the most famous structures in the city is the Astronomical Clock. The clock looks like it was taken straight out of Harry Potter! We climbed up to the top of it and the views were incredible. Prague is a beautiful city and even prettier from this viewpoint. It was amazing to look down on the city and see everywhere we've gone from just one spot.
