Thanks to RyanAir, I snagged a very cheap flight to go to Brussels for the weekend with a few of my friends!  Before the trip, I didn't know much about the country and my main priority was the food (*this probably shouldn't be a surprise*).  Although I am now exhausted, I learned so much in just my short 40 hours in the country and I already want to go back!  Below are some of my highlights from the weekend... (don't worry, I'm starting with the food!)

## WAFFLES!

*Seconds before having the best waffle of my life*

Oh my goodness... Belgium is knows for its amazing waffles for a reason!  The moment we got to the city I had to order one right away.  We went to Maison Dandoy: a famous place to get waffles and has been around since 1829!  They had many options for what you could put on your waffle, and of course I went with ice cream and caramel!  It was amazing and was the best waffle I've ever had in my life.

But of course, one waffle isn't enough so later in the weekend I went to a cheap 1 Euro waffle store and got a waffle with nutella and banana!  Brussels was very cold and snowy so having a nice warm waffle at least once a day just seemed necessary!

## Fries on fries on fries

*The first of many trips to Fritland*

The fries in Belgium were so incredible!  I guess this shouldn't be that surprising, but oh my gosh!  There were so many different sauces you could get with your fries and each time I got fries (which was 3 times in not even 2 days...) I tried a different sauce!  We went to Fritland the most and it was always so packed.  You had to almost push yourself up in the line to get your fry order in.  I hadn't had fries since being home in the USA so it probably helped the fries taste even better!!! They definitely beat McDonalds fries!

## Delirium Cafe: the bar with the most beer in the world!

*Outside of Delirium*

We went to a bar called the Delirium Cafe and it has the Guinness World Record for most beer at a bar in the world!  It is huge and very popular.  The 3 of us ordered many different beers to try some of their crazy flavors!  My favorite one that I tried was a cherry flavored beer and another crazy one was a cactus beer.  They had so many more ridiculous ones that we didn't get to, including a chocolate and cookie beer!  I guess this means I will have to come back!

## The Atomium

*Outside of the Atomium!*

This crazy looking building is called the Atomium and was created in the late 1950s for Brussels World's Fair.  It is known as one of Europe's most bizzar buildings... and it's pretty clear why!  We went up to the top of it on a snowy day and the views were very pretty.  I can only imagine how gorgeous it is on a sunny summer day!

In front of the building, there was a huge sign that said "be.WELCOME", meaning that Belgium welcomes you.  It was really cool especially since everyone I met in Brussels mentioned how everyone has a place in this city!

## A Gorgeous and Unique City

*The famous Manneken Pis*

Brussels was definitely one of the most unique cities I've ever visited.  One of the reasons why is that they're famous for a small fountain of a young boy peeing!  It is very important to the country and has been around for hundreds of years.  They even have thousands of different costumes for him on special occasions!  He is called the Manneken Pis and is one of the tourist highlights of the city.

One of the most beautiful parts of the city was the Grand Place.  In the square, you are surrounded by gorgeous old buildings with many gold details on them!  The large building I am posing with below is the Town Hall which was constructed in 1402.  Another great perk of this square was that it was surrounded by amazing chocolate shops that all had free samples!! Gotta love free Belgian chocolate!

It was such a fun weekend, even if it meant taking a train, shuttle, bus, car, and plane to get there and back!  I'm looking forward to going to London this weekend and then the week after than I start my spring break!  Stay tuned!! :)

Ciao! <br>
