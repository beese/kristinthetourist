As cliché as it may sound, I have fallen in love with the beautiful city of Paris!  When I first saw the Eiffel tower I was in complete awe, and I even enjoyed my very first macaron!  The city is full of beauty, culture, and delicious food. Even though I barely know any french except for ballet terms, I am already looking forward to returning to Paris this summer!

My top highlights of Paris include...

Going up to the very top of the Eiffel tower.  It was windy, but so amazing to go to the top of such a famous tower.  I am very grateful that I'm not afraid of heights because or else it would have been difficult!

Seeing the Mona Lisa at the Louvre.  It was pretty funny that we went straight to the Italian section of the museum, since we are surrounded by Italian art in Florence, but so cool to see the famous and mysterious da Vinci painting!

<br>
Going to the Musée d'Orsay.  The past few months I have seen many classic Renaissance and traditional art pieces, so it was very interesting to see a museum with many impressionist masterpieces!  I am a big fan of Monet, Degas, and Van Gogh so I enjoyed seeing some of their most famous pieces in person.

<br>
Seeing the twinkling lights of the Eiffel tower at night!  So beautiful!! While we watched the twinkling lights, there was a violinist playing gorgeous music.  It felt unreal!

French food!  I has an amazing french onion soup, many different french cheeses, many crepes (including a peanut butter banana one), and my first macaron at <a href="https://www.laduree.com/en_int/" target="_blank">Laduree</a>!
