After a 7 hour bus ride from Prague, we made it to Budapest!  Below are my top highlights from touring the city!

## Budapest Thermal Baths

We spent a full relaxing day at the Sz√©chenyi Thermal Baths.  After busily traveling many cities, it was so nice to take time to relax!  I even got a 20 minute massage at the baths.  Safe to say I had a great day!  The thermal baths were beautiful and it was definitely the highlight of my time in Budapest.


## River Cruise on the Danube River

On our last night in the city, we went on a river cruise.  The cruise was very fancy and had a full buffet of traditional Hungarian food!  There was also a string quartet playing beautiful music, including many songs from musicals!  We enjoyed the beautiful night on the Danube river and it was the perfect way to end our long spring break trip.

## Learning about the City's History

The city has a very rich and sad history.

While walking along the river, we saw Shoes on the Danube Bank.  It is a memorial for the people that were killed by fascist Arrow Cross militiamen in Budapest during WW2.  The memorial was only made in 2005, many years after the horrible incident happened in 1945.

We also went to the House of Terror museum. It was about the fascist and communist regimes in 20th century Hungary.  It was very intense visit but I highly recommend the museum to anyone traveling to Budapest.

## The Parliament Building

This building is one of my new favorites in Europe!  It is the Budapest Parliament Building and I find it to be so beautiful.  It is the largest building in Hungary and the tallest building in Budapest.

I had a great time in Budapest!  Also, look forward to more blog posts soon about Cinque Terre, Paris, and the Amalfi Coast!

Ciao! <br>
