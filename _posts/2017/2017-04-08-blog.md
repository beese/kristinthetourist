My friend Madison and I decided to go on a last minute trip to the Amalfi Coast, and it ended up being one of my favorite weekends abroad so far!  We traveled around to the beautiful towns of Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Positano, and Amalfi.  Also, check out a vlog I made of this weekend below! <br>

## Naples
Naples is the home to one of my favorites foods... PIZZA!  We were only in Naples for a few hours, so we used our time wisely and went to one of the most famous pizza places in the world.  We stopped at L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele, a pizzeria that has been open since 1870!  We both ordered HUGE margarita pizzas and I managed to finish almost all of mine surprisingly!  Definitely one of the best pizzas I've ever had!

## Capri
Capri is an island off the coast of Sorrento.  It is so incredibly beautiful and magical!  We took a boat tour aroud the island that included getting in a small row boat to see the famous Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra).  The Blue Grotto is a cave that has beautiful glowing water inside.  The glowing effect is created by having sunlight passing through an underwater cavity and then shining up though the water.  It is truly magical!  This island was my favorite place that I have been to in Italy so far.

## Positano
Positano is a gorgeous costal town with a beautiful beach!  Madison and I were blown away by the beauty of this cute little town, and we even saw a proposal happen on the beach!  Unfortunately it wasn't warm enough to go swimming, but it was still so beautiful to relax on the beach and take in the scenery.

## Amalfi
Amalfi is the last town we stopped at before heading home.  It was larger and more touristy compared to Positano, but still very pretty.  We enjoyed some great Southern Italy food, napped on the beach, and shopped around in the Artisan shops down the main street.

Overall it was such an incredible weekend!  Hopefully <a href="https://youtu.be/BGFG98FhewI">this video</a> can capture more of the beauty Southern Italy has!
