I absolutely loved my time in London!  My boyfriend hopped the pond for the weekend to explore the UK with me and we had a great time.  London reminded us a lot of NYC, except more spread out and that the cars drive on the wrong side of the road and that everyone sounds like they are a character from Harry Potter.  I also made a video of my weekend that you can check out at the bottom of this post! :)

## Double Decker Bus Tour

Our first night we took a bus tour around the city!  It was great to see the city at night from the top of a double decker bus.  Unfortunately, it rained and got very windy!  We bundled up in our rain ponchos *(provided by the tour company of course)* and stayed shivering on the open air upper level of the bus.

## Big Ben and Parliament Square

Today was our sunny day in the city!  We wandered through Parliament Square and took a surplus of touristy photos, complete with the classic telephone booths and Big Ben.  The square was gorgeous and packed with people; it reminded us a little bit of Times Square in NYC!

*We had to wait in a long line to get this photo... It was worth the wait!*

## London Eye

Since it was such a beautiful day, the line for the Eye was very long.  We waited for about an hour and then we were up!  I am so happy we waited because the views were incredible.  You could see the whole city!

## Shakespeare's Globe Theatre

The original Globe Theatre was built in 1599 by Shakespeare's playing company.  It was destroyed in a fire in 1613, and then was rebuilt again.  Today, you can see a different reconstruction of the theatre that opened in 1997.  It is constructed to look almost identical to the original and has an exhibition about Shakespeare.  We took a guided tour and it was so fascinating to hear about the history!

**Fun Fact:** Shakespeare and I share the same birthday.  *I felt pretty special touring my birthday twin's famous theatre!*

## Pub Tour!

We met up with our friend Maggie from Purdue and went on a Pub Tour together!  Our funny and very tipsy tour guide took us to the best and oldest pubs in the city and we enjoyed some of the best beer London offers.  One of the pubs we went to was called "Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese" and has been there since 1538!  It was rebuilt in 1667 after the Great Fire of London.  The inside had some very low ceilings so Alec and I *(being the giants that we are)* had to crouch around many times to avoid getting hit in the head!

## West End

Being the musical geek that I am, we had to see a West End show!  We really wanted to see the musical Matilda because it has incredible reviews and offers 5 pound tickets to students.  Unfortunately, they sold out of the discount tickets minutes before we were about to purchase ours!  Instead we saw a different West End musical called Half a Sixpence.  It was very cute and funny!  It was so nice to have a taste of Broadway for the night to make us feel like we were back in NYC.

## Buckingham Palace

On our last day in London, we saw a Changing of the Guards ceremony at Buckingham Palace.  It was very interesting and involved a lot of shouting, horses, and marching!  The crowds were insane!  But a perk of being tall was that we could just barely peak in through the gates to watch what was happening.  It was a really cool experience and I was so grateful I got to see it!  I used my camera's very large zoom to get some closeups!

London was incredible and I really hope I can go back someday!  It was so nice to visit a city with some good American style comfort food too... I was craving a good cheeseburger!  I hope that next time I can check out the museums, and possibly the Harry Potter Experience!
