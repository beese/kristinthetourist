After spending a week in Florence, I decided to adventure out into more of Tuscany!  I visited the Fiesole Hills, Pisa, and Lucca.

## Fiesole Hills

Fiesole is a small town right outside of Florence that is filled with scenic hills, beautiful gardens, and farms.

I hiked up to the top of Monte Cerceri, the same place where Leonardo da Vinci practiced flying experiments in 1506.  After hiking the equivalence of 58 floors to the top of the hill, we were in the same place where Leonardo's servant jumped off and attempted to fly.  I couldn't believe how high up we were, and I definitely would not have wanted to jump off the hill!  Instead, we enjoyed the breathtaking views looking down upon Florence.

While wandering around Fiesole, we met an olive farmer who let us tour his property.  He was a very kind Italian man whose family had been olive farmers for generations.  He toured us around his gorgeous house, olive tree farm, and we even got to see his 2 donkeys!

## Pisa

Pisa is only an hour train ride away from Florence, which makes for a great day trip!  My friends and I were happy that we could travel by train together for the first time to avoid getting lost.  But, we couldn't open the exit door of the train in time so we missed our stop in Pisa!  We ended up at a coastal city called Viareggio.  Luckily a kind person helped us get back on the train and we ended up in Pisa again... this time opening the door correctly!

We all went straight towards the Leaning Tower of Pisa to take our cheesy touristy photos.  To take the classic holding up the tower photo, you had to stand on a small pillar which took more balance than expected!  My friends had to help me up, but it was worth it for the cliché pic!

*Look, it's me saving a monument from falling!*

One thing that surprised me about the tower is how much it bothered me that it wasn't straight!  I guess it isn't every day that you see a tower lean like that, but my OCD couldn't handle it!  The tower was also a lot larger than I expected.

Pisa ended up being a fun little city to explore.  After taking many photos with the tower, we wandered down the small curvy streets.  The Arno river, which flows through Florence, also goes through Pisa.  The river area of their town looked very similar to Florence!

An unexpected find in Pisa was Tuttomondo: a large mural created by Keith Haring.  Haring made it in 1989 and the mural symbolizes peace and harmony in the world.  Definitely a hidden gem in the city!

## Lucca

Since we had more time in Pisa than expected, we took a train to the nearby town Lucca!  Lucca is famous for its Renaissance era walls that surround the city, and for being home of the famous opera composer Puccini.  I loved how cute, small, and quiet the town was compared to Pisa and Florence.  My friends and I wandered around the town finding cute little shops, a circular piazza, and gorgeous old buildings.

*Of course I had to get tiramisù gelato... amazing!!!*

I had a great weekend hiking up the Fiesole Hills, and touring Pisa and Lucca!  I am looking forward to more weekend trips in the future.  Having 4 day weekends comes in handy!! I am already planning on going to Rome next weekend!

Ciao! <br>
