Cinque Terre was amazing!  Cinque Terre means "5 Towns" in Italian... representing the 5 seaside villages on the Italian Riviera coastline.  They are famous for the colorful houses on the cliffs, a very famous pinterest travel destination!  The 5 towns are Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore.

We spent our first day in Monterosso.  The moment we got off the train we were greeted by palm trees and the huge sandy beach! It was incredible to believe I was just a few hours away from Florence!  Monterosso has a huge sandy beach and a very laid back culture.  We all layed out and relaxed on the beach for the rest of the day!

*Loving the beach life in Monterosso!*



Sunday we hiked through all 5 towns.  Usually this hike take 4-5 hours, but unfortunately the easier hiking path was closed for renovations.  Since we still wanted to hike, we ended up doing a hike made for "expert excursionists" that ended up being a little extreme!

**12.3 miles, 26,663 steps, and a whopping 290 flights of stairs climbed** by the end of the hike. It was the hardest hike I've ever gone on (I was sore for days!), but also one of the most beautiful! We started in the furthest north town (Monterosso) and hiked to the 4 other villages. There were parts where we basically had to climb rock wall and I almost felt like I was on Survivor or something!  The views made all of the uphill climbing worth it.

We enjoyed fresh squeezed lemonade at a woman's home along the hike too! The woman gives hikers free water and she had a guest book that we signed as well.

We also noticed that the area around each town had very unique vegetation. It was so hard to believe we were in Italy the whole time! It was so gorgeous and reminded me of some of the rocky northern California coasts. After the hike, we treated ourselves to a nice lunch in Riomaggiore including splitting a bottle of an Italian Rose wine! It was a lovely day and very exhausting!

I left Cinque Terre feeling like jello, but it was all worth it! I hope that I can come again someday!
