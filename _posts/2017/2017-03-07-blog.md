Berlin was the first stop of my 10 day spring break trip. When you think of spring break usually you imagine a tropical beach and the sun, so we had a bit of a different break this time in Northern Europe! We all fell in love with Germany and we already want to explore more of the country.  Being mostly German, it was also very exciting to see the country that I'm from.

## The Sights of Berlin
Berlin is a huge city compared to Florence! It is very urban and doesn't look like a typical old German town.  The center of the city has a large train station called Alexanderplatz and nearby there is the famous TV tower and a world clock. The spire was made in the 60s to be the tallest structure in Germany. We were able to get a great view of the city and of the spire by climbing up to the Berlin Cathedral. It was really cool, but we also realized that Berlin isn't the most gorgeous European city. This is mostly because many buildings got bombed in WW2 so they had to rebuild many buildings in the 50s and 60s.

## Currywurst, schnitzel, and beer!
German food is awesome! The classic food for Berlin is called currywurst. It's a grilled sausage cut up and tossed in a ketchup curry sauce with curry powder on top. It was delicious and a little spicy! I had it twice and it was amazing both times.

My friends and I went to a traditional German Beer Garten and we had such a great experience. I ordered k√§se spatzel which is similar to a very creamy Mac and cheese with fried onions on top! It was amazing! All of us also got huge 1 liter steins of different beers. We had to have the classic German experience! The restaurant had live music and we all danced to it on the dance floor! It was a blast!

## Berlin's History
On our second day, we went on a walking tour with a fantastic guide who specializes in German history of the 20th century. We learned many shocking facts of the city's past and got to see some of the most important parts of the city:
* Checkpoint Charlie: this was one of the checkpoints that people could go through when the Berlin Wall was up. There were Soviet and American soldiers on each side and today there are even men dressed up as American soldiers that tourists take photos with.
* The Holocaust Memorial: this memorial was created in 2004 in memorial of the millions of people murdered in the holocaust. The memorial was designed in such a way that you are forced to walk through it one by one and it has an effect of making you feel lost, alone, trapped, and cold. When you walk through it, the ground slopes lower and lower and the air gets colder. It was a very chilling and sad experience since the designer of the memorial wanted to make the person going through it feel similar to how many people felt in the concentration camps.

* Our tour guide stopped us at a parking lot and we all didn't expect to learn anything interesting of the area, but it's actually above Hitler's bunker where he lived during the last year or so of his life and where he killed himself. Many people think it would be a fascinating museum, but the city decided to fill the bunker with cement and dirt instead. Our tour guide told us this was mainly because the city had enough sad reminders of WW2 and that they wouldn't want the museum to draw the wrong crowd.
* Our guide also took us to the memorial of one of the book burnings. It is in the square where the 40,000 books were burned. Today there is a window on the floor of the square and when you look into it you see a ton of empty bookshelves. The designer wanted there to be enough empty bookshelves to hold 40,000 books. It was very eery and effective in communicating how devastating the burning was.

On our last full day in the city we went to the Topography of Terror museum. The museum takes you through the devastating facts of WW2 in Germany and how Hitler gained power. It is supposed to be a non-emotional and fact focused WW2 museum, but my friends and I all had trouble making it through the museum because it was so disturbing. The museum was incredible and extremely eye opening.

## East Side Gallery
There are remains of the Berlin Wall across parts of the city. One section of the wall along the river was turned into an art gallery with graffiti art on the wall. We walked along the wall and looked at all of the different art. It was awesome and was one of my favorite parts of Berlin.
