One of the most breathtaking trips I have gone on so far is definitely Malta!  I spent 3 full days in Malta and I was blown away by the beauty.  From the crystal clear blue waters, to the gorgeous city architectures, and the rugged terrain, Malta has a lot to offer.  Below are the top highlights from my trip!

# Cruise to the Blue Lagoon
We took a cruise that brought us all around the islands of Malta. The best part was spending time at the Blue Lagoon! We enjoyed swimming in the crystal clear waters and taking in the scenery.

# Exploring Gozo
Gozo is the island northwest to the largest island.  We spend a few hours exploring it.  It is known for it's famous Azure Window, but unfortunately weeks before our trip the window (a natural stone arch) collapsed into the sea.  Although we couldn't see the famous landmark, we still enjoyed exploring the island's historical city of Victoria and its rocky coastline.

# Mdina
We spent some time walking through the old streets of Mdina.  The region of Mdina was founded in the 8th century BC by Phoenician settlers.  Later in the medieval period, it became a fortified city and was also the capital of Malta.

# Blue Grotto
Similar to Capri, Malta also has a Blue Grotto.  We took a boat ride down through the caves on the coast admiring the beautiful blue water.

# Valletta
Valletta is the current capital of Malta. We toured around the city on Easter and saw many people out enjoying themselves on the holiday. The city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the buildings date back to the 16th century.

# Marsaxlokk
This adorable fisherman's village was so fun to visit!  The town is filled with colorful fishing boats, loads of good food, and shopping.  We enjoyed a boat trip around the bay where the boat driver showed us their tuna farms.

Malta was a dream!  And I managed to not get sun burnt the whole weekend, which is a big accomplishment for me!

Ciao! <br>
