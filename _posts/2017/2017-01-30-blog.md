30.8 miles of walking around the city, 3 trips to Gelato stores, 1 incredible cannoli, 2 coins thrown into the Trevi Fountain, 2.5 hours spent waiting in line to see the Vatican Museum for free, 1 opportunity to see the Pope, and 4 hours spent traveling on the train.  Below are some of the highlights of my excursion…

## Trevi Fountain

On my first day in Rome, we immediately wanted to see the famous Trevi Fountain.  The fountain is larger than life and surrounded by tons of tourists; I can’t image how busy the fountain is in the middle of the summer!  My friends and I threw multiple coins in the fountain and made many wishes.  The legend is that if you throw in a coin, you are destined to come back! I sure hope that’s true because Rome is amazing, and it’s a city that you can’t explore in just one weekend.

## Walking Tour

My friends and I went on a free walking tour of Rome that was incredible!  We saw the Piazza del Popolo, the Pantheon, the Tomb of Augustus, the Spanish Steps, the street that Galileo used to live on, and a lot more of the city!  Something I found interesting was that current day Rome was built on top of ruins from Ancient Rome.  Due to many floods, the Romans decided to build their city on top of the old one.

## Colosseum & Roman Forum

The Colosseum was incredible and larger than life!  I have seen so many photos of it my entire life, and it was so cool to finally see it in person.  The ticket to the Colosseum also included admission to the Roman Forum.  Seeing the Colosseum and Roman Forum was one of my favorite moments of the weekend!

## Vatican Museum

On the last Sunday of every month, the Vatican Museum is free!  Being cheap college students, my friends and I felt that we had to take advantage of this deal.  Money saved on museums means more money for gelato, right?!  We had to get in like at 6:30 AM and we waited outside until 9 AM when the museum opened.  The line got incredibly long and many people didn’t make it inside the museum if they didn’t get there early enough.

Once we finally got inside the museum, the 2.5 hours spent outside in the cold was so worth it!  Every room had so much detail in it with paintings all over the walls and ceilings.

The absolute highlight of the museum for me was the Sistine Chapel.  I was completely in awe and spent at least an hour in the chapel completely mesmerized by the incredible artwork.  Michelangelo’s work is incredible and the most beautiful art I have seen in my life!  Some of the humans he painted looked like they were statues popping out of the ceiling.  It is so incredible to think that he painted all the ceiling himself and his gorgeous large fresco called The Last Judgement.  You aren’t allowed to take photos or videos in the room, which makes sense because a photo would not give it justice for how beautiful it is!  I highly recommend going to see this if you are ever in Rome!

## Seeing the Pope

One of the biggest surprises of the weekend was finding out Pope Francis would be speaking on Sunday at noon!  We made sure to be out of the Vatican Museum in time to see the Pope speak.  There were thousands and thousands of people in the large Piazza San Pietro looking up to a window where the Pope would appear to speak.  My friends and I had to quickly go through security and run through the crowds to get in a spot where we could see the Pope.  Seeing him speak was incredibly surreal!  Although it was all in Italian and I could only understand a few words, it was an amazing experience.  At the end of his speech tons of colorful balloons flew into the sky and the whole crowd cheered and waved at the Pope.  I am so happy that I got to see him.  The only bummer was that my nice camera with a 42x zoom wasn’t working on Sunday, so I unfortunately didn’t get to take nice zoomed in photos of him.  Instead, you can enjoy my pixelated iPhone photo!

## Food

On Saturday night, my friends and I had dinner at a place called Tony’s Restaurant.  For 20 Euro you got a 7 course meal with unlimited wine and water!  All the food tasted great and I even enjoyed the calamari; which is a big deal for me since I am not a seafood fan!

The gelato was amazing!  My favorite place was called Della Palma and they are famous for their 150 Gelato flavors.  Other great sweets included an incredible cannoli right by the Trevi Fountain!  It beats the cannolis I had in Little Italy last summer!

Rome was breathtaking and I hope I will be back again someday.  I took many videos on the weekend trip, so be on the lookout for a small video of my experiences in Rome as well!

Ciao! <br>
