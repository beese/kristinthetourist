![A few photos of me on my travels](http://static.kristinthetourist.com/AboutMe.jpg)
<br>
Hello! I'm Kristin and I'm a junior at Purdue University studying Computer Science.  This year I'll be spending more days out of the USA than in it, so I thought I should track my travels as I wander through Europe from January 12th&ndash;August 5th, 2017!

I will be starting in Florence, Italy as I spend my semester studying abroad. I'll be taking Photojournalism, Intro to Watercolors, Cultural History of Florence, and Italian.  Very different from my typical Computer Science semester at Purdue!  The classes sound awesome and the Italian food and wine is definitely a plus!

For the summer I will be in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland interning at Google working on YouTube.  I can't speak any German, but luckily all of the engineers speak English!  I am looking forward to the beautiful mountainous landscapes, my project at Google, and the Swiss chocolate of course!

Although this long journey is a bit daunting, I am very excited for the experiences that lie ahead.  To follow me on my touristy travels throughout Europe, be sure to [subscribe](/subscribe) to get email updates for when I post a new blog!

Ciao! <br>
Kristin
